# e3nn

## e3nn main
:christmas_tree: The core features of the library has been rewritten in the branch :sparkles:[e3nn:main](https://github.com/e3nn/e3nn/tree/main):sparkles:.
- `CustomWeightedTensorProduct` is now [`TensorProduct`](https://docs.e3nn.org/en/latest/api/nn/nn_tp.html#e3nn_core.nn.tensor_product.TensorProduct) and its method `.right()` replaces `Kernel`.
- `Rs` lists are replaced by the more powerful [Irreps](https://docs.e3nn.org/en/latest/api/o3/o3_irreps.html#e3nn_core.o3.irreps.Irreps) object.
- Rotations functions from `o3` have been completed by [quaternion and axis-angle support](https://docs.e3nn.org/en/latest/api/o3/o3_rotation.html).
- Spherical harmonics are implemented as tensor products [`Y^{l+1} = Y^l \otimes (x,y,z)`](https://docs.e3nn.org/en/latest/api/o3/o3_sh.html#e3nn_core.o3.cartesian_spherical_harmonics.spherical_harmonics) and are faster.
- Code examples are documented [here](https://docs.e3nn.org/en/latest/examples/examples.html)

## Intro

E(3) is the [Euclidean group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_group) in dimension 3. That is the group of rotations, translations and mirror.
`e3nn` is a [pytorch](https://pytorch.org) library that aims to create **E**(**3**) equivariant **n**eural **n**etworks.

## Installation

After having installed [pytorch_geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric#installation) run the command:

`pip install e3nn`

To get the CUDA kernels read the instructions in `INSTALL.md`.

## Example
```python
from functools import partial

import torch

from e3nn import rs
from e3nn.kernel import Kernel
from e3nn.non_linearities.norm import Norm
from e3nn.non_linearities.rescaled_act import swish
from e3nn.point.operations import Convolution
from e3nn.radial import GaussianRadialModel

# Define the input and output representations
Rs_in = [(1, 0), (2, 1)]  # Input = One scalar plus two vectors
Rs_out = [(1, 1)]  # Output = One single vector

# Radial model:  R+ -> R^d
RadialModel = partial(GaussianRadialModel, max_radius=3.0, number_of_basis=3, h=100, L=1, act=swish)

# kernel: composed on a radial part that contains the learned parameters
#  and an angular part given by the spherical hamonics and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
K = partial(Kernel, RadialModel=RadialModel)

# Create the convolution module
conv = Convolution(K(Rs_in, Rs_out))

# Module to compute the norm of each irreducible component
norm = Norm(Rs_out)


n = 5  # number of input points
features = rs.randn(1, n, Rs_in, requires_grad=True)
in_geometry = torch.randn(1, n, 3)
out_geometry = torch.zeros(1, 1, 3)  # One point at the origin


out = norm(conv(features, in_geometry, out_geometry))
out.backward()

print(out)
print(features.grad)
```

  - `e3nn/rs.py` geometrical tensor representations
  - `e3nn/image` contains voxels linear operations
  - `e3nn/point` contains points linear operations
  - `e3nn/non_linearities` non linearities operations
- `examples` simple scripts and experiments
